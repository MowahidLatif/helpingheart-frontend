      <h1>How It Works</h1>
      <p>
        Helping Hands is designed to make launching your own donation page as
        easy as possible — no coding, no complications, just results.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Sign Up & Get Your Custom Link</h2>
      <p>
        Create your account and instantly claim your own fundraising subdomain,
        like:
        <code> helpinghands.ca/yourname</code>. This will be your personal
        donation homepage.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Create Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        Inside your dashboard, you can create as many campaigns as you want.
        Each campaign can have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A custom title and description</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, documents, and other media</li>
        <li>A donation goal and live progress bar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Share & Collect Donations</h2>
      <p>
        Share your campaign link or QR code with friends, family, or your
        community. Donations can be made directly through the campaign page, and
        each donor can optionally leave a message.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Real-Time Dashboard & Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        Your dashboard gives you insight into how each campaign is performing,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total donations collected</li>
        <li>Recent donors</li>
        <li>Messages left by supporters</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 5: Send Receipts & Run Giveaways (Optional)</h2>
      <p>
        Automatically send email receipts to donors, and even run a giveaway by
        randomly selecting a winner from your donor pool.
      </p>

      <h2>That's it!</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're raising money for a personal cause, a nonprofit, or a
        one-time project, Helping Hands gives you the tools to do it
        professionally — and fast.
